## 🚀 How to Test

### 1. Start Docker Desktop
Make sure Docker Desktop is running on your machine.

### 2. Deploy the Complete Stack
```bash
cd /Users/premkalyan/code/P360
./deploy-p360-67.sh
```

### 3. Test the Fixed UI
Once deployment completes, test these endpoints:

**Primary Target (P360-67):**
```bash
curl -I http://localhost:7600/dashboard/campaigns

```

**Other Endpoints:**
```bash
# Homepage
curl -I http://localhost:7600/
# Should return: 200 OK

# Health Check
curl http://localhost:7600/api/health
# Should return: {"status": "healthy", ...}

# Auth Pages
curl -I http://localhost:7600/auth/login
curl -I http://localhost:7600/auth/signup
# Should both return: 200 OK
```

### 4. Browser Testing
Open in browser:
- **Main Target:** http://localhost:7600/dashboard/campaigns
