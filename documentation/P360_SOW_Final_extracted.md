Overview of the Initiative  P360 needs to build a Display Advertising Platform (“DAP”) to manage audience creation, campaign management, and performance tracking to enable core business operations with modern, scalable technology to support growth.  Problem & Solution: With Microsoft sunsetting Xandr in February 2026 and P360’s separation from Integrate, the business risks disruption to its core business operations. Additionally, there are current dependencies on third-party DSPs limit flexibility, increase costs, and fragment workflows across audience creation, campaign execution, and performance reconciliation. Without a replacement platform in production by January 9, 2026, P360 cannot meet committed customer deliverables or capture revenue from the first customer dollar on schedule.  There is a time-sensitive opportunity to build a self-owned, integrated Display Advertising Platform that unifies audience generation, campaign orchestration, and performance reconciliation within the context of P360’s business model. By embedding direct integrations with key partners (TTD, Bombora, etc.), the platform can improve operational efficiency and increase P360’s share of the customer dollar. The platform will create reusable components (e.g., Audience Builder) that drive long-term scalability and innovation beyond 2026.  Objectives: Client and Bounteous aim to ensure business continuity and operational onboarding enablement by Project end, prior to the sunsetting of Xandr.

● Ongoing technical build of the MVP including (through Agile development sprints): o Tech foundation & data model o Data integration o Audience management o Campaign orchestration o Attribution & reporting o User & system activity o Front-end & UI build for the respective modules ● Ongoing demos & sprint reviews   ● Run deployments across environments   ● Ongoing execution of QA, system integration testing, and defect resolution ● Support for SIT/UAT owned by P360 ● Launch planning, deployment, and cutover ● Hypercare support & defect resolution (3 weeks) ● Finalized MVP sprint backlog & user stories incl. test plans and reports ● Finalized data model and technical solution (ERD) for MVP ● Finalized product playbook & technical documentation 
 Key Assumptions: • Bounteous team members will be provided all the necessary documentation, architectures, SOPs and accesses to complete their required activities prior to the start of the project. A delay in access and onboarding will delay the project start date and may lead to increased costs. • Bounteous resource mix may be periodically adjusted to address the nature of the required services, but Bounteous will inform the Client in advance. • Client is responsible for coordinating with other vendors as needed to complete the non-Bounteous scope of work. • Client will procure licenses to all the required tools and software identified as part of this scope.   • Client will provide access to appropriate decision makers that will also service as points of contact for Bounteous team.  • Client will provide business and technical experts, as needed, for discussions, meetings, artifact reviews, and descriptions of current processes and requirements. Client will manage the internal stakeholders. • There will be no designs created by Bounteous as part of this specific scope. All designs including copy will be provided by the Client prior to the start of the project. Client will be responsible for the UI, Componentry, and Experience. While there is planned Hypercare support post-launch, Bounteous will not be responsible for enhancements, only critical/high priority bugs. • Client will complete the required designs before development begins. Bounteous will coordinate closely with the Client to align project milestones with design readiness. • Access to relevant systems should be provided by the Client during the first week of the project. • Bounteous will produce technical design, ERD and solution blueprints including relevant architectures

Project Completion 1/19/26 Enhancements from UAT, and Hypercare support ends.  Considerations affecting the schedule:  ● Provisioning of procured technology upon Project Kickoff ● Execution of this SOW beyond August 18, 2025 increases timeline risk of Schedule ● Designs for DAP feature set are not complete; these must be completed prior to build start ● TTD and Bombora (third-party vendors) data availability and contract readiness must be completed prior to Project Kickoff  1.8. Team Model  Bounteous  Bounteous will provide a mix of personnel from North America and India with varying allocations throughout the project based on activities. The Bounteous team model may be periodically adjusted to address the nature of the required Services. The various roles on the Project will be: • Program Manager • Scrum Master • Product Manager • Solution Architect • Software Developer (Full-Stack/Front-End/Back-End) • Data Architect

 Due to the heightened risk of the Xandr cutover in February of 2026, Bounteous will also align incentives by placing $90,000 of fees at risk. The fees at risk are based upon production deployment, with the ability for users to leverage the platform capabilities to successfully serve Client end-customers, including audience creation, campaign creation and management, and outcomes reporting.  Begin Date Last Date Fees Forfeited Anytime  1/9/2025 $0 1/10/2025 1/16/2025 $45,000 1/17/2025 Anytime $90,000  Client and Bounteous will work collaboratively to ensure platform readiness for these dates, including MVP definitions, managing third-party dependencies, and overall program issues and risks to mitigate risk for Client and Bounteous.  2.2. Bounteous Investment   Bounteous will provide a one-time investment of $283,160 which is accounted for in the above total fees. In support of the partnership, Client will partner with Bounteous to launch: • A co-branded partnership announcement upon Project Kickoff • A co-branded success story upon Project Completion  2.3.

Client will also reimburse Bounteous for reasonable fees and disbursements incurred or charged by third-party experts engaged by Bounteous from time to time with Client’s prior written consent.    Expenses will not exceed 5% of the fees associated with this SOW, which is equal to $27,000.  3. PAUSE AND RESTART WORK   Should any of the Services in this project need to be paused for reasons attributable to Client (e.g., explicit project pause request, prolonged inability for Bounteous to access necessary environments, unavailability of agreed upon dependencies, etc.), Client acknowledges that Bounteous may reallocate its resources to other clients. Should this occur, Bounteous will make every effort to reclaim those resources once such Services can resume but makes no guarantee this will be possible. Furthermore, Client acknowledges that pausing any of the Services may result in additional costs and time to complete the project than originally estimated in this SOW, which shall be the responsibility of Client.
