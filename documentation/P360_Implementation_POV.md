  - Rollback procedures

### 3. **Technology Stack Recommendations**

#### **Core Recommendations** âœ…
The proposed stack is well-architected and enterprise-ready:

1. **Python FastAPI Backend**
   - Excellent for high-performance async operations
   - Strong typing with Pydantic models
   - Extensive ecosystem for integrations

2. **Next.js Frontend**
   - Server-side rendering for performance
   - Strong TypeScript integration
   - Production-ready with Vercel deployment options

3. **AWS Cloud Infrastructure**
