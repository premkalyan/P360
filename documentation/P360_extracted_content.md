## Slide 5
--------------------
Background & Context
Bounteous has maintained a long-standing relationship with Integrate since 2019. In Jan 2025, at the direction of the former CEO, we rebadged our entire Professional Services team (~28 associates) to Integrate.

Post the structural separation of Integrate Inc. and Pipeline360 (P360), we have been in active engagement with the leadership of both firms and their PE sponsor, Audax. This has led to a renewed relationship with P360.

Integrate used to be focused on what P360 is today, but with separation of entities as ‘Integrate’ & ‘P360’, they have unique business goals and solutions that are connected yet distinct. 

Integrate while operating as a single entity used to do B2B lead generation via Display advertising through Xandr (MS platform), but Xandr is sunsetting in Feb 2026 and with the separation of Integrate & P360 as 2 distinct BUs, P360 plans to build a custom Display Advertising tool to continue operations and that’s where BNTS comes into the picture to help them build this new platform. 

Know more about Integrate & Pipeline360 here:
https://www.integrate.com/ (focused on B2B lead management & data governance)
https://www.pipeline-360.com/ (focused on generating high-performing B2B leads with Display advertising)

## Slide 6
--------------------
Challenge
With Microsoft sunsetting Xandr in February 2026 and Pipeline360’s separation from Integrate, the business risks disruption to its core business operations. 
Current dependencies on third-party DSPs limit flexibility, increase costs, and fragment workflows across audience creation, campaign execution, and performance reconciliation. 
Without a replacement platform in production by December 19, 2025, Pipeline360 cannot meet committed customer deliverables or capture revenue from the first customer dollar on schedule.
Opportunity
There is a time-sensitive opportunity to build a self-owned, integrated Display Advertising Platform that unifies audience generation, campaign orchestration, and performance reconciliation within the context of Pipeline360’s business model. 
By embedding direct integrations with key partners (TTD, Bombora, etc.), the platform can improve operational efficiency and increase Pipeline360’s share of the customer dollar.
The platform will create reusable components (e.g., Audience Builder) that drive long-term scalability and innovation beyond 2026.

## Slide 7
--------------------
Over the past ~3-4 weeks, we’ve collaborated with Pipeline360 to define a clear MVP path for a successful December launch.
Over the past three weeks, Bounteous has partnered with Pipeline360s leadership, product, and technology organization to:
Establish a baseline understanding of business operations, technology 
Determine the requirements for a successful December launch
Establish a future-proof solution architecture to support new capabilities and services for 2026 and beyond
Estimate the effort and prioritize features for MVP based on impact and effort
Craft the teams and workstreams; map dependencies and create an execution plan to ensure a successful, on-time launch

And together we defined a solution:
The proposed solution is to design, build, and deploy Pipeline 360’s DAP MVP by December 19, 2025, ensuring readiness for the first customer dollar and operational independence from Xandr and Integrate.
Enabled by Build accelerators, and scalable cloud architecture, the solution will support high-volume processing, real-time integrations, and laying the foundation for advanced capabilities in 2026.

Notable out of scope items for the MVP
Marketplace 
Performance Optimization (recommendation engine for users to improve campaign outcomes)
Forecast Generation Engine
Migration of active campaigns; existing campaigns will organically ‘sunset’ during the cutover window (Dec ‘25 – Feb’26)
Migration of active audiences; MVP will allow ops users the ability to configure audiences via UI
While the Roles & Permissions will be parameterized and highly configurable, only 3 personas included for MVP (Admin, Campaign Mgr, Marketer); there will be no UI for roles & permissions configuration
Audience scoring: intent scoring thresholds or trending signals
Bulk record reconciliation of unmapped Opportunities, Programs, and Campaigns
Super Admin role to impersonate users for debugging.
Comprehensive Audit Trail (UI), start with BE only audit trails for MVP, UI to come later

Roles & Permissions: Secure, Configurable & Granular
Goal: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) model that separates authentication from authorization. Faster response to access change requests, granular control over feature access, and future-proofing for new roles or permissions.

Authentication: Microsoft Entra ID verifies user identity.

Authorization: Roles and permissions are fully managed in our application database, allowing business teams to adjust access without IT involvement.

AI Led SDLC Tools & Recommendations
Bounteous will work closely with Pipeline360 to create an environment to leverage AI tools for SDLC activities. Our proposal is to use Amazon Q / GitHub Co-pilot for efficient development of the solution. AI will support our Build across: 

Support Behavior Driven Development by converting Requirements into a script format that helps in Automation
Code Generation for front-end  and back-end capabilities
Test Case Generation
Comments and Document Generation
Validation of Secure Code Practices
Code Profiling
Infrastructure as a Code generation for creating infrastructure components in AWS
Applying organization Coding standards
Effective Code Reviews
Bounteous recommends using AWS Bedrock with Claude/GPT models, specifically for enabling the technical components like Audience Builder, FAQ etc.
