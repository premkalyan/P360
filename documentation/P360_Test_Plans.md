## Defect Management Strategy

### 🐛 **Defect Classification**

#### **Severity Levels**
- **Critical (P0)**: System down, data loss, security breach
- **High (P1)**: Major functionality broken, performance degraded
- **Medium (P2)**: Minor functionality issues, workaround available
- **Low (P3)**: Cosmetic issues, enhancement requests

#### **Priority Matrix**
```
              High Impact    Medium Impact    Low Impact
High Urgency     P0             P1             P2
Med Urgency      P1             P2             P3
Low Urgency      P2             P3             P3
```

### 🔄 **Defect Lifecycle**

#### **Defect States**
1. **New**: Defect reported and awaiting triage
2. **Assigned**: Defect assigned to developer
3. **In Progress**: Developer working on fix
4. **Testing**: Fix implemented, awaiting verification
5. **Verified**: Fix verified, awaiting deployment
6. **Closed**: Defect resolved and deployed
7. **Reopened**: Defect reoccurred after fix

### ✅ **Defect Management Checklist**

#### **Defect Reporting**
- [ ] **Issue Template Standardization**
  - [ ] Steps to reproduce
  - [ ] Expected vs actual behavior
  - [ ] Environment information
  - [ ] Screenshots/logs attachment

- [ ] **Triage Process**
  - [ ] Daily defect review meetings
  - [ ] Severity and priority assignment
  - [ ] Developer assignment
  - [ ] Stakeholder notification

#### **Defect Resolution**
- [ ] **Development Process**
  - [ ] Code fix implementation
  - [ ] Unit test coverage for fix
  - [ ] Peer review requirement
  - [ ] Regression testing

- [ ] **Verification Process**
  - [ ] QA testing of fix
  - [ ] User acceptance validation
  - [ ] Deployment verification
  - [ ] Post-deployment monitoring
