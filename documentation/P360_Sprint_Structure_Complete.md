## üöÄ **IMMEDIATE ACTION ITEMS**

### **‚úÖ What's Complete:**
1. **5 Sprints Created**: All sprints exist in JIRA with proper IDs
2. **48 Stories Assigned**: All identified stories properly assigned to sprints
3. **Team Assignments**: Clear role-based story assignments
4. **Dependencies Linked**: 21 critical dependencies established
5. **Unit Testing Framework**: 5 unit test stories created and linked

### **üéØ Next Steps:**
1. **Start Sprint 1**: Use `start_sprint` with sprintId: 15215
2. **Set Sprint Dates**: Manually set 2-week sprint durations in JIRA UI
3. **Assign Team Members**: Assign specific individuals to story roles
4. **Story Points**: Set story points once MCP API is fixed
5. **Sprint Goals**: Set detailed goals manually in JIRA UI (MCP limitation)

### **üìã Manual Configuration Needed:**
Since some MCP functions have API limitations, the following should be done manually:
- **Sprint Goals**: Set detailed sprint objectives in JIRA UI
- **Sprint Dates**: Set start/end dates for each sprint
- **Story Points**: Assign estimated story points to all stories
- **Subtask Management**: Review and adjust subtask assignments
