The following screens will let you view the details of various screens that are available for organization, which is under admin login. The first one would be the landing screen, where there are no organizations yet in the system. There is an image in the center, please extract and use it. There are four tabs at the top, organization, user, activity log, and settings. Logos at the very top with search anything, and bell and user icon. Please have a detailed look. The second screen is about list organizations. We need to create this grid component with sort and filter, search options, and at the bottom right, there is a left and right arrow navigations. Bottom left, page 1 out of 5, depending on number of results, we will have to show, so person can switch to any page. Slide 3, or image 3, talks about creating an organization, which will come over the grid, and it will have the details user can fill in, and click save as draft. And you can also give some IDs, and then click on confirm. That is screen number 4. Screen number 5 is, user has option to copy these environment declaration IDs right now. I am assuming, yeah, and then you can also add users to the organizations who are in the system. So right now, just add some users and we are able to add. And as soon as user added is visible at the bottom, we can delete them. The next screen talks about successful organization created, message at the bottom, and go back to the grid view. Then you have option to, you know, three options at every row, edit, share, activity, log are the three. This is visible in the last option for every row, where you have three dots. Then you can actually, when you click on edit, again the same page comes that we did for create organizations, people can add and update. Then there is an activity tab on top of create organization or edit organization. So when you click on it, there is another message that comes, that's the next screen. So pretty complicated way, you can see all activities. Then within the organization, when you select an organization, it will expand, and it will show different users, I think. I'm not clear, but at least keep it that way. And then when you click on an organization, again, from the grid, you will be able to see the right side of the organization where you have all activities and actions. Again, in all activities, actions, there is a dropdown where you can select last 24 hours, last one week, last one month, make it configurable.
