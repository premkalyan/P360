Login page has 1 screen 3 variations
First variation Is an empty screen where user can enter login and password, second Second variation is where user actually keeps using password as soon as he gives the username and some password the login gets enabled. Third is either of them goes wrong and you show erro message

Order three, Figma URL, from here, you can download all the assets, All assets needs to be saved in the local project, so don't use any remote assets download and keep them within the workspace

We already have the login page implemented, but I think the background is little bright and we need exactly the same background and please verify for spacing everything as per the figam
